I am plant pathologist specialising in quantitative epidemiology and disease management. Currently, I am Associate Professor in the [Departmento de Fitopatologia](http://www.dfp.ufv.br) at the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV) since February 2014. My primary responsibilities include **teaching** (plant diease epidemiology and data analysis) and **mentoring** graduate students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/graduate).

**Research** in my Lab includes both computational/data science (dry lab) and experimental/observational bench/field science (wet lab). Students working in the "dry lab" develop skills in disease and loss assessment methods; modeling temporal progress and spatial spread; risk assessment and prediction; yield loss and economic modeling. The "wet lab" research includes genotyping and phenotyping of plant pathogens for a range of  traits related with reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance. The currently studied pathogens include mycotoxigenic __*Fusarium*__ that cause blights or rots in winter and summer crops and __*Pyricularia*__ blast of rice, wheat and grasses.

I've acted as Associate/Senior Editor for a few journals. Currently, I am **Editor in Chief** for [Tropical Plant Pathology](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/) (2017 to 2021). Along with [Adam H. Sparks](https://adamhsparks.netlify.com/) I co-founded [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org), an initiative to support and promote the spread of open, transparent and reproducible practices such as early and open sharing of data and results via preprints.
