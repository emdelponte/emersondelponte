I am plant pathologist specializing in quantitative epidemiology and disease management ([CV](cv/). Currently, I am Associate Professor in the [Departmento de Fitopatologia](http://www.dfp.ufv.br) at the [Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa](http://www.ufv.br)(UFV). I am responsible for **teaching** (plant disease epidemiology and data analysis) and **mentoring** graduate students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/graduate).

**Research** in my Lab includes both simulation and data-driven modeling approaches (dry lab) and experimental/observational bench/field work (wet lab). The "dry lab" projects involve quantitative approaches for measuring disease and assessing crop loss assessment methods; modeling temporal progress and spatial spread across scales; assessing and predicting disease risk and using meta-analytic models. The "wet lab" research includes genotyping and phenotyping of plant pathogens (reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance). We study two most dangerous pathogens worlwide: __*Fusarium*__ species that cause blights or rots in winter and summer crops and __*Pyricularia*__ blast of rice, wheat and grasses.

I've always been serving the scientific community in several ways. I've acted as Associate Editor for a few journals and, currently, I am **Editor in Chief** for [Tropical Plant Pathology](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/). Along with [Adam H. Sparks](https://adamhsparks.netlify.com/) I co-founded [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org), a non-profit initiative to support and promote the rapid share of knowleadge and spread of reproducible practices in plant pathology science.
