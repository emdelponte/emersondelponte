I am plant pathologist specializing in quantitative epidemiology and disease management ([See CV](cv/)). I lead a *Research Lab* that focus on using both simulation and data-driven modeling approaches and experimental/observational bench/field work). The computational work involves methods for measuring disease and assessing crop loss assessment methods; modeling temporal progress and spatial spread across scales; assessing and predicting disease risk and using meta-analytic models. The *wet lab* research includes genotyping and phenotyping of plant pathogens (reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance). We currently study two of the most dangerous pathogens worlwide: __*Fusarium*__ species that cause blights or rots in winter and summer crops and __*Pyricularia*__ blast of rice, wheat and grasses. Follow-me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/edelponte) to get the latest news from our Lab.

I've served as Associate Editor for a few journals and, currently, I am **Editor in Chief** for [Tropical Plant Pathology](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/). Along with [Adam H. Sparks](https://adamhsparks.netlify.com/) I co-founded [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org), a non-profit initiative to support and promote the rapid share of knowleadge and spread of reproducible practices in plant pathology science. Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte) and [OSF](http://osf.io/jb6yd) for collaborative work using #rstats.
