I am [plant pathologist](https://www.apsnet.org/careers/careersinplantpathology/Pages/default.aspx) specialized in the epidemiology and management of plant diseases ([CV](/cv/)). I lead a science Lab where people can be trained in and conduct two major types of work. A more quantitative and computational (simulation and statistical models) and/or experimental or observational bench or field work (aka wet lab). The computational works covers a broad range of areas in plant disease epidemiology, and is not pathogen-specific, including:

- Assessment of disease intensity and crop loss
- Modeling temporal progress and spatial spread across scales
- Assessment and prediction of disease risk
- Systematic reviews and meta-analytic modeling

The *wet lab* research is focused mainly on genotyping and phenotyping of fungal pathogens (reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance). We have conducted a series of studies on two of the most dangerous plant pathogens worlwide: mycotoxigenic __*Fusarium*__ that cause blights or rots in winter and summer crops and __*Pyricularia*__ blast of rice, wheat and grasses. Follow-me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/edelponte) to get the latest news from our Lab.

I've been involved and dedicated significant amount of tie in scholarly peer-review since early in my carrer. I've served as Associate Editor for a few journals. Currently, I am **Editor in Chief** for [Tropical Plant Pathology](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/). Along with [Adam H. Sparks](https://adamhsparks.netlify.com/) I co-founded [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org), an initiative to support and promote the rapid share of knowleadge and spread of openess culture and reproducible practices in plant pathology science. Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte) and [OSF](http://osf.io/jb6yd) for collaborative work using #rstats.
