I am [plant pathologist](https://www.apsnet.org/careers/careersinplantpathology/Pages/default.aspx) specialized in epidemiology and management of plant diseases ([CV](/cv/)). I lead a research Lab where two major kinds of work are conducted. One that is focused on computational approaches (simulation and statistical models) and another that is based on observational or experimental research associated with bench work (wet lab). The computational work is non pathogen-specific and covers a broader range of topics in plant disease epidemiology, including:

- Assessment of disease intensity and crop loss
- Modeling temporal progress and spatial spread across scales
- Assessment and prediction of disease risk
- Systematic reviews and meta-analytic modeling

The wet lab research is focused mainly on genotyping and phenotyping of fungal pathogens (reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance). Currently, we study two of the most dangerous plant pathogens worlwide: mycotoxigenic __*Fusarium*__ that cause head blights or ear rots in winter and summer crops and __*Pyricularia*__ blast of rice, wheat and grasses.

I've been involved in scholarly peer-review since early in my carrer. I've served as Associate Editor for a few journals. Currently, I am **Editor in Chief** for [Tropical Plant Pathology](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/), the journal of the Brazilian Phytological Society, which is the [fastest-growing](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/post/citescore-2018/) one among journals published by the major plant pathology societies worldwide. 

Along with [Adam H. Sparks](https://adamhsparks.netlify.com/) I co-founded [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org), an initiative to support and promote the rapid share of knowleadge and adoption of open and reproducible practices in plant pathology.
