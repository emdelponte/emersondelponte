I hold a DSc in Plant Pathology (Univ. Federal de Pelotas, 2004) with 2-year PostDoc training in risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University). Currently, I am Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and mentoring (masters and doctorate) responsibilities. I currently lead a research Lab and chair the Graduate Program in Plant Pathology at UFV. Also, I serve the Brazilian Phytopathological Society as Editor in Chief of Tropical Plant Pathology (2017 to 2021) and the global plant pathology community by co-leading the Open Plant Pathology initiative.

## Data, codes and preprints

I strongly advocate for an open and reproducible research culture that may ultimate lead to a more accessible, transparent and reliable science. All data and computational codes produced in my Lab are made available ahead of the peer-reviewed publication. I use GitHub for open and colaborative coding and Open Science Framework (OSF) for permanent archive.
