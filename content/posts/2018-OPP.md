During the last two years I became interested in embracing open science practices - open data, codes and access aiming at improving reproducibility of the research conducted in the lab. Since then, I decide that:

- All data and R scripts from our Lab's papers should be made available on GitHub and permanently stored somewhere
- The analytical procedures should be documented as much as possible and capable of being fully reproduced by others
- Pre-prints should be posted in advance of manuscript submission for enhanced visibility, feedback and open accessibility

## First steps

My first reproducible report using a single R Markdown file was published by late 2016. I generated html outputs for a commented analysis for a [meta-analysis paper](https://emdelponte.github.io/paper-white-mold-meta-analysis/). The files are available for download at [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/emdelponte/paper-white-mold-meta-analysis) and, after installing the required packages, the entire report can be generated by kniting the `rmd` files to produce a single `html` output for visualization of the report. 

## Structuring a research compendia

After a few months, I was working on a new standard for organizing and documenting the research-derived data and R codes on GitHub. Inspired by a [ideas from others](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg), I structured an R Markdown website for producing a readable version of a research compendium - a compilation of data and computer code to reproduce the results of a publication. This was my [first template](https://emdelponte.github.io/paper-FHB-Brazil-meta-analysis/index.html) which was further modified and used in another recent analysis report for a [paper](https://emdelponte.github.io/paper-FGSC-fitness/). For this new one, the files were stored permanently at Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/c2mbr/)) and a [pre-print was posted in BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/18/235895) for enhanced visibility and accessibility. My suggested minimum combo is: 

- Store the entire directory and files at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) (OSF) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) (where you can get a DOI)
- Host the files at a GitHub repo 
- Push the website files to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) or GitHub pages.

Although more [complex structures](makes a custom isolated computational environment for the project), such as distributing the compendium as R packages and making a custom isolated computational environment for the project (docker) can be developed, I preferred to keep it at a minimum. There are only four `rmd` files and two folders, for `data` and `docs` folder which contain the html output after kniting. A template for the research compendium is available for [download](https://github.com/emdelponte/research-compendium-website). Given the simplicity and appealing presentation, it seems to be getting some attention by other people who are using it for producing documents for the analysis.

## Why not formalize a network?

Earlier this year, after hours of late night and early morning discussions (me in Brazil and Adam Sparks in Australia), we thought that an environment for discussing, sharing experiences and educating in open science and reproducible research practices was lacking for plant pathologists. We were able to identify a few other colleagues valuing the sharing of data and codes in plant pathology journals. Some of them have been already teaching [reproducible science in R](http://grunwaldlab.github.io/Reproducible-science-in-R/) - workshop offered at the APS meeting in 2016 by [Grunwald's Lab](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/). A permanent space for bringing together these guys interested in sharing experiences and building capacity in reproducible research was envisioned.


We then invited a few colleagues to join a [Slack workspace](https://openplantpathology.slack.com/) where we brainstormed and decided to found [Open Plant Pathology - OPP](https://www.openplantpathology.org/). OPP is a community of researchers from various backgrounds interested in adopting and promoting reproducible research practices using open source software, data and repositories. It has been a great opportunity to interact and know other people in the Slack workspace where ideas are flowing and collaborations on the rise. We just wrote a [blog post](https://www.openplantpathology.org/post/2018-05-20-second-post-five-month-summary/) in OPP where we provide a quick summary of the first five months of OPP is presented. Get to know [OPP](http://www.openplantpathology.org) and consider joining our community!
