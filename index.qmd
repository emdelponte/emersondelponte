## Welcome!

<img src="figs/delponte6.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%; margin-right:30px" width="180px" align="left"/> My name is Emerson Medeiros Del Ponte, a professor from the Federal University of Viçosa, Brazil. I teach plant pathology/epidemiology and data science, conduct scientific research in the field of plant pathology, develop apps for supporting research and teaching,and prepare future professionals and leaders.<br><br><br>

## Resumé

I hold a DSc in Plant Pathology (Universidade Federal de Pelotas, 2004) with a one-year visit to Cornell University (Bergstrom Lab). I worked two years as as a postdoc associate in a project involving disease risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University). Currently, I work at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and student [mentoring](lab.html) (masters and doctorate) responsibilities.

## Services

I've been involved in scholarly peer-review since early in my career. I've served as associate editor for a few journals, including Plant Disease. Currently, I am Editor in Chief for [Tropical Plant Pathology](www.sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp), the journal of the [Brazilian Phytopathological Society](www.sbfitopatologia.org.br) Since 2022, I am also serving as associate editor for the [CABI Agriculture & Bioscience](https://cabiagbio.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board) (Plant Pathology Section) and the [European Journal of Plant Pathology](https://www.springer.com/journal/10658/editors) journals.

## Open Science

I strongly advocate for an open and reproducible research model and culture that may ultimately contribute to a more accessible, transparent and reliable science. This led me to co-found [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org/) initiative together with [Adam Sparks](https://adamhsparks.netlify.app/). In my Lab, we make use of [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during our research are made available ahead of peer-review. You can find our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte). The research outcomes are organized and shared as a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/) and [preprints](https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/preprints) of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/jb6yd)).

## Talks and videos

Slides of some of my talks are hosted in my [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/emdelponte) account and full videos of talks and lectures can be found on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fmW_hoXOY_YR23EtlYvZg) channel.
