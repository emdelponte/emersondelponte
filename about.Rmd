## Resumé

I hold a DSc in Plant Pathology (Univ. Federal de Pelotas, 2004) with a 2-year PostDoc training in risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University). Currently, I am Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and [mentoring](lab.html) (masters and doctorate) responsibilities. You can get access to my peer-reviewed publications in my academic profile websites: [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4398-409X), [publons](https://publons.com/researcher/2740078/emerson-m-del-ponte/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LgNDabAAAAAJ&hl=en), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emerson-Del-Ponte/research).

## Services

I've been involved in scholarly peer-review since early in my career. I've served as Associate Editor for a few journals, including Plant Disease. Currently, I am Editor in Chief for [Tropical Plant Pathology](www.sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp), the journal of the [Brazilian Phytopathological Society](www.sbfitopatologia.org.br).

## Open Science

I strongly advocate for an open and reproducible research model and culture that may ultimate contribute to a more accessible, transparent and reliable science. This led me to co-found [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org/) Initiative together with [Adam Sparks](http://adamhsparks.com). In my Lab, we make use of [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during our research are made available ahead of peer-review. You can find our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte). The research outcomes are organized and shared as a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/) and [preprints](https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/preprints) of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/jb6yd)).
