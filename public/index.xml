      <description>I had the privilege to attend, as a newcomer, the 12nd ed. of the International Epidemiology Workshop (IEW) in Lillihammer, Norway, during early June 2018. We were in a relatively small group of 50 plant epidemiologists from several countries around the world that interacted in several ways during three days of presentations of talks and posters and time for discussion.

      <title>From reproducible research reports to Open Plant Pathology</title>

      <description>During the last two years I became interested in embracing open science practices - open data, codes and access aiming at improving reproducibility of the research conducted in the lab. Since then, I decide that:
 All data and R scripts from our Lab&amp;rsquo;s papers should be made available on GitHub and permanently stored somewhere The analytical procedures should be documented as much as possible and capable of being fully reproduced by others Pre-prints should be posted in advance of manuscript submission for enhanced visibility, feedback and open accessibility  First steps My first reproducible report using a single R Markdown file was published by late 2016.</description>

      <description>I am plant pathologist specialized in epidemiology and management of plant diseases (CV). I lead a research Lab where two major kinds of work are conducted. One that is focused on computational approaches (simulation and statistical models) and another that is based on observational or experimental research associated with bench work (wet lab). The computational work is non pathogen-specific and covers a broader range of topics in plant disease epidemiology, including:</description>

This led me to co-found Open Plant Pathology Initiative. In my Lab, we make use of R language and Tidyverse for all statistical and data science related activities.</description>

Federal de Pelotas, 2004) with 2-year PostDoc training in risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University) (CV). Currently, I am Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and mentoring (masters and doctorate) responsibilities.</description>

More recently I have given a few webinars. The slides of the most of my recent talks are available for visualization or download at SpeakerDeck (SD).</description>
