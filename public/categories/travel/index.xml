      <description>I had the privilege to attend, as a newcomer, the 12nd ed. of the International Epidemiology Workshop (IEW) in Lillihammer, Norway, during early June 2018. We were in a relatively small group of 50 plant epidemiologists from several countries around the world that interacted in several ways during three days of presentations of talks and posters and time for discussion.
