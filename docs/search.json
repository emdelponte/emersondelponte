Federal de Pelotas, 2004) with a 2-year PostDoc training in risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University). Currently, I am Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and mentoring (masters and doctorate) responsibilities. You can get access to my peer-reviewed publications in my academic profile websites: ORCID, publons, Google Scholar, ResearchGate.\nServices\nI’ve been involved in scholarly peer-review since early in my career. I’ve served as Associate Editor for a few journals, including Plant Disease. Currently, I am Editor in Chief for Tropical Plant Pathology, the journal of the Brazilian Phytopathological Society.\nOpen Science\nI strongly advocate for an open and reproducible research model and culture that may ultimate contribute to a more accessible, transparent and reliable science. This led me to co-found Open Plant Pathology Initiative together with Adam Sparks. In my Lab, we make use of R language for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during our research are made available ahead of peer-review. You can find our code on GitHub. The research outcomes are organized and shared as a research compendium and preprints of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework (OSF).\n\n\n\n",

These include assessment of several traits such as: reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance. Currently, we study two of the most dangerous plant pathogens worldwide: mycotoxigenic Fusarium that cause head blights or ear rots in winter and summer crops and Pyricularia blast of rice, wheat and grasses.\nMembers\nGustavo B. dos Santos (M)Kaíque dos Santos Alves (M, D)Jhonatan Paulo Barro (M, D)João Paulo Ascari (D)Ignácio Cazón (D)\nFormer members\nUFV\nSheila M.
