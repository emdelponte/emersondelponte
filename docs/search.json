    "text": "We make use of statistical and mathematical models as well as conduction of field, greenhouse and laboratory experimental work to measure, understand, compare and predict plant disease epidemics.\nThe modeling work is non pathogen-specific and covers a broad range of topics in plant disease epidemiology, including: assessment of disease intensity and crop loss; modeling temporal progress and spatial spread across scale; assessment and prediction of disease risk and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analysis.\nThe experimental research is focused on genotyping and phenotyping of fungal pathogen populations. These include assessment of several traits such as: reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance. Currently, we study two of the most dangerous plant pathogens worldwide: mycotoxigenic Fusarium that cause head blights or ear rots in winter and summer crops and Pyricularia blast of rice, wheat and grasses."

I worked two years as as a postdoc associate in a project involving disease risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University). Currently, I work at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and student mentoring (masters and doctorate) responsibilities. You can get access to my peer-reviewed publications in my academic profile websites: ORCID, publons, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or Lattes."

This led me to co-found Open Plant Pathology initiative together with Adam Sparks. In my Lab, we make use of R language for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during our research are made available ahead of peer-review. You can find our code on GitHub. The research outcomes are organized and shared as a research compendium and preprints of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework (OSF)."
