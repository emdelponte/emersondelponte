This led me to co-found Open Plant Pathology initiative together with Adam Sparks. In my Lab, we make use of R language for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during our research are made available ahead of peer-review. You can find our code on GitHub. The research outcomes are organized and shared as a research compendium and preprints of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework (OSF)."

These include assessment of several traits such as: reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential and fungicide resistance. Currently, we study two of the most dangerous plant pathogens worldwide: mycotoxigenic Fusarium that cause head blights or ear rots in winter and summer crops and Pyricularia blast of rice, wheat and grasses."
