    "text": "We utilize statistical and mathematical models, and conduct field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments to measure, understand, compare, and predict plant disease epidemics.\nOur modeling work is not confined to specific diseases and encompasses a wide spectrum of topics within plant disease epidemiology. This includes the assessment of disease intensity and crop loss, modeling the temporal progress and spatial spread across different scales, evaluating and predicting disease risk, as well as conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\nOur experimental research primarily revolves around the genotyping and phenotyping of fungal pathogen populations. This encompasses evaluating various traits such as reproduction, pathogenicity, aggressiveness, toxigenic potential, and fungicide resistance. Currently, we are studying two of the most significant plant pathogens globally: mycotoxigenic Fusarium, which causes head blights or ear rots in winter and summer crops, and Pyricularia blast affecting rice, wheat, and grasses."

I worked two years as as a postdoc associate in a project involving disease risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University). Currently, I work at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) where I have both teaching and student mentoring (masters and doctorate) responsibilities. You can get access to my peer-reviewed publications in my academic profile websites: ORCID, publons, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or Lattes."

This led me to co-found Open Plant Pathology initiative together with Adam Sparks. In my Lab, we make use of R language for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during our research are made available ahead of peer-review. You can find our code on GitHub. The research outcomes are organized and shared as a research compendium and preprints of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework (OSF)."
